Ricty Diminished - fonts for programming.
Patched for powerline and vim-powerline.
Forked from GitHub: mzyy94/RictyDiminished-for-Powerline.

In Windows 7 the original fonts were not recognized correctly
because of too long font names.
Names of the fonts here are modified to be short enough.

Ricty Diminished is under the SIL Open Font License (OFL) Version 1.1.
